### **Game Rules**

1. **Game Mode**:  
   - Supports Player vs. Player / Player vs. AI battle modes.  
2. **Blessing Mechanism**:  
   - Before each major round, players select a condition to trigger a blessing (e.g., attack hit, getting hit, or successfully blocking).  
   - When the condition is met, the system grants a random buff, such as increased attack power or health recovery.  
3. **Small Round Battles**:  
   - Players take turns as attackers and defenders, choosing attack or defense directions (left, middle, right).  
   - If the directions differ, the attacker successfully hits and deals damage. If the directions match, the defender blocks the attack successfully.  
4. **Victory Conditions**:  
   - The player who loses all their health during a small round loses.  
   - If no winner is decided after 10 small rounds, the game ends in a draw, and no points are awarded.  
5. **Match End**:  
   - The match follows a best-of-three format, with the first player to win two rounds declared the winner.
